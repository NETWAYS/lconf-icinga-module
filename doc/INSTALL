1) Prerequisites

You need a running mysql and php (with PEAR and CLI) environment w/ icinga-web and ido (ido2db).
Phing is required for installation but shipped with this module (see phing.php at the root folder)



2) Installing the module

   1) Change the settings in db.ini to fit to your db-settings.
 
   2) Install the module by calling ./install.sh and answering the questions. 
      If anything should go wrong check the error messages and read the FAQ, perhaps this can help you.
   
   3) Add the principals for the users who should be allowed to use the lconf module (Admin->Users->select user->add Principal)
   
   4) Now you should see a "LConf" Entry in the main toolbar. If not, try to clear the cache by typing "rm -r /path-to-icinga/app/cache/*"

 
3) Removing the module
	
   1) rm -r %your_icinga_path%/app/modules/LConf

   2) run the removal script under etc/sql/remove/ if you also want to delete your connection settings
