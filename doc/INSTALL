1) Prerequisites

You need a running mysql and php (with PEAR and CLI) environment w/ icinga-web and ido (ido2db).
Phing is required for installation - as it comes with icinga-web, you can find it under "/path-to-icinga-web/bin/phing" if
you don't have installed it seperately.
 



2) Installing the plugin

   1) Change the setting db.ini to fit to your db-settings. Currently only MySQL support is guaranteed.
 
   2) Install the plugin by typing "phing install" and answering the questions. 
      If anything should go wrong check the error messages and read the FAQ, perhaps this can help you.
   
   3) Add the principals for the users who should be allowed to use the lconf module (Admin->Users->select user->add Principal)
   
   4) Now you should see a "LConf" Entry in the main toolbar. If not, try to clear the cache by typing "rm /path-to-icinga/app/cache/config/*"

   5) (Optional) If you want to integrate lconf to the host/service/hostgroup/servicegroup view:
   	  run phing install-cronk in the CronkIntegration directory

3) Removing the plugin
	
   1) Go to /path-to-icinga-web/plugins/

   2) Type phing remove
 
   3) Type "LConf" if you're asked which plugin should be removed
